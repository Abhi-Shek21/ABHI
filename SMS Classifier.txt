# Step 1: Data Preprocessing
import pandas as pd

# Load the SMS dataset
data = pd.read_csv('sms_spam.csv')

# Step 2: Feature Extraction
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(data['text'])
y = data['label']

# Step 3: Model Building
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the SVM model
svm_model = SVC(kernel='linear')
svm_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Model Evaluation
# Evaluate the model
y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Step 5: Deployment (Optional)
# Once satisfied with the model performance, deploy it in a production environment
# for real-time classification of SMS messages.
